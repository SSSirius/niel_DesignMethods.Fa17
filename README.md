*Remix*

The poem I chose is from Macbeth Act V Scene V, the famous soliloquy "tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow".
> She should have died hereafter;
> There would have been a time for such a word.â€”
> To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
> Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
> To the last syllable of recorded time;
> And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
> The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
> Life's but a walking shadow; a poor player,
> That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
> And then is heard no more: it is a tale
> Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
> Signifying nothing.

The rules I set are:
1. Scrolling
2. Text Transform
3. Visibility
4. Interaction
5. Visual Contrast
